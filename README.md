# Budget-Planner-
The budget planner helps the user budget their monthly income. The user can rank their most-needed items in that month and eventually tell them whether they should buy an item or not. It also prioritizes the item based on the EisenHower's Matrix Urgent\Important matrix. This is a value proposition this budget planner has because as soon as you rank the importance and urgence level of the items you want to buy, it gives you a list you should buy in order, which helps indecisive people like me. If the item is over your expected budget for the month, then it is also eliminated immediately. The user can also make an educated guess whether they are spending over their limit.//

# Budget-Planner-
The budget planner helps the user budget their monthly income. The user can rank their most-needed items in that month and eventually tell them whether they should buy an item or not. It also prioritizes the item based on the EisenHower's Matrix Urgent\Important matrix. The user can also make an educated guess whether they are spending over their limit.
